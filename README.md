## 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Charles —  Data Scientists | Technologist | Data Systems Architect | AI Visionary

### 🧠 About Me

I build **Analytical Intelligence Infrastructures** — modular systems that automate data reasoning, forecasting, and decision support.
At the heart of my work lies a simple belief: *true intelligence isn’t just in models; it’s in the architecture that connects them, automates them, and lets them think autonomously.*

My foundation is in **Mechanical Engineering**, which taught me the discipline of systems thinking, how to design frameworks that balance logic, precision, and scalability.
Today, I apply that mindset to **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation**, building tools and infrastructures that turn raw data into continuous, self-learning intelligence.

I’m fluent in **Python** and **SQL**, and deeply familiar with the major **data and AI libraries** that power modern analytics — from `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `Prophet`, and `Streamlit`, to automation workflows using APIs and schedulers.
My focus isn’t just to analyze data, but rather, it’s to engineer **data intelligence systems** that operate independently, learn continuously, and serve real-world contexts.

### ⚙️ Current Focus

🚀 **ADIP (Analytical Data Intelligence Platform)** — A modular intelligence infrastructure designed to automate data ingestion, analysis, forecasting, and human readable summarization across multiple sectors.

The first deployment of this system is the **Autonomous EdTech Analyst for Africa** — an AI-driven agent capable of ingesting educational data, generating insights, and producing adaptive reports without manual input.

This project focuses on architecting the backbone of autonomous analytical systems that can scale across industries like **FinTech, AgriTech, and Public Policy Analytics**.

### 🌍 Mission

I’m driven by a long-term vision to build **Africa’s Analytical Intelligence Infrastructure** — scalable systems that democratize access to intelligence, improve data driven decision making, and empower local innovation.

Every project I build is a node in that vision — from automation pipelines to autonomous analysts — each one moving closer to a future where **AI systems think in context, act with precision, and serve humanity’s progress**.
