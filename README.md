## 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Charles — Data Engineer | Python Developer | AI Automation Builder

### 🧠 About Me

I design and build modular data automation systems pipelines that ingest, clean, structure, analyze, and forecast data with minimal human intervention. My foundation is in **Mechanical Engineering**, which taught me the discipline of systems thinking, how to design frameworks that balance logic, precision, and scalability.
Today, I apply that mindset to **Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Applied AI, and Automation**, building tools and infrastructures that turn raw data into continuous, self-learning intelligence.
I don’t just analyze data — I build the systems that make intelligence repeatable, scalable, and automatic.
 
I’m fluent in **Python** and **SQL**, and deeply familiar with the major **data and AI libraries** that power modern analytics from `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `Prophet`, and `Streamlit`, to automation workflows using APIs and schedulers.
My focus isn’t just to analyze data, but rather, it’s to engineer **data intelligence systems** that operate independently, learn continuously, and serve real-world contexts.

### ⚙️ Current Focus

🚀 **ADIP (Automated Data Intelligence Platform)** — 
I’m developing a modular engineering framework that automates:

- Data ingestion (APIs, scrapers, batch feeds)
- ETL processing
- Forecasting models
- Analytical summaries and human-readable insights
- Optional dashboards for exploration

The first deployment of this system is the **Autonomous EdTech Analyst for Africa** — this is a system built to process education datasets, detect patterns, generate narratives, and support real-world decision-making.

ADIP is my long-term foundation for industry-grade data intelligence systems applicable to FinTech, AgriTech, Logistics, and Public Policy analytics.

### 🌍 Mission

I’m driven by a long-term vision to build **Africa’s Analytical Intelligence Infrastructure** — scalable systems that democratize access to intelligence, improve data driven decision making, and empower local innovation.
Every project I build is a node in that vision: automation pipelines, modular analysts, forecasting engines, and intelligence frameworks designed for reliability in low-resource environments.
